Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Erin! Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer from Pensacola, Florida, who specializes in JavaScript
and PHP (WordPress) development. In my day job, I work at a local music as a solo developer, but
I also occasionally take on interesting contract projects for local companies.

Iâ€™m also a semi-professional trumpet player, private brass teacher, and former public school
band director. I graduated from the University of West Florida in 2013 with a dual Bachelorâ€™s
degree in Music and Music Education.
