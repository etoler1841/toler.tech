Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Erin! Iâ€™m a web developer from Pensacola, Florida who specializes in JavaScript and PHP development. I started
writing code as a hobby in 2015, and it became my full-time career in 2017. Today, I work at a local music as a solo
developer, but I also occasionally take on interesting contract projects for local companies.

Iâ€™m also a semi-professional trumpet player, private brass teacher, and former public school band director. I graduated
from the University of West Florida in 2013 with a dual Bachelorâ€™s degree in Music and Music Education.
