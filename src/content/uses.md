### Languages & Frameworks

- Whenever I can, I‚Äôm working in TypeScript.
  - My preferred front-end framework is React.
  - I‚Äôm also dipping into Svelte, which is what I used to build this site.
  - I‚Äôm comfortable working with vanilla JS as well, and I can jump into a project that‚Äôs still running jQuery pretty easily, too.
  - On the back-end, I use Node for my runtime, although I want to see what some of the newer alternatives have to offer soon.
  - For writing a web server, I‚Äôve historically used Express. I think I‚Äôm done with it though, and next time I need a standalone web server, I‚Äôll probably use Hono.
  - I‚Äôve been using Next.js for the last couple of years for all my full-stack JS apps, and I‚Äôve used it at least once strictly as a web server.
  - I‚Äôve written 90% of an app in Electron. This will probably be my first and last foray into Electron, as Tauri looks more interesting to me.
- I‚Äôm also comfortable in PHP. It was my first language, so it will always hold a special place in my heart.
  - I started writing PHP in about 2015. At the time, my focus was on hacky patches and tooling for ZenCart, none of which followed any kind of best practices.
  - I still write PHP pretty often, but it‚Äôs in the context of WordPress themes and plugins. I especially work a lot in WooCommerce.
  - I‚Äôve also built a couple of apps in Symfony and Laravel. I liked using both, but I still prefer something like Next.js whenever possible.
- I‚Äôve worked pretty equally in relational and document databases (mostly MySQL and MongoDB).
  - I‚Äôve recently started exploring Supabase and I really like it.
  - I‚Äôve been forced to work with MSSQL throughout my career. I am not a fan of the Transact-SQL syntax, but I can use it if I have to.
- I‚Äôve built a single automation system in NetLinx. It was a neat experience and I would do it again, even though I have complaints about the tooling and some of the language conventions.
- I‚Äôve dabbled in Python, Go, Rust, and C#. I‚Äôm certainly not an expert in any of them, but I‚Äôm interested in learning more!

### Editor

- I‚Äôm a Visual Studio Code devotee. I converted early on in my coding journey (late 2018) and haven‚Äôt looked back.
  - For my theme, I use my own Jade theme, which is a fork of Wes Bos‚Äôs Cobalt 2 but green.
  - Victor Mono is my font of choice, mostly because its cursive variant is also monospace, which makes docblocks way easier to format.
  - I use a gazillion extensions, but the ones I most highly recommend are Better Comments, Codeium, PHP, TypeScript Import Sorter, VS Sequential Number, WordPress Hooks Intellisense, and WordPress Snippets.

### OS

- I‚Äôm comfortable in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments, but my primary workstations are all Windows machines. I do own a 2020 MacBook Pro, but I really hate the feel of the keyboard, so I almost never use it. Windows does what I need it to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Other Apps

- Firefox is my daily driver. Maybe I‚Äôll eventually switch back to Chrome, but I‚Äôve always had performance issues with it, which is why I switched several years ago.
- I don‚Äôt pride myself on my UI/UX design skills, but when I do work in that space (like I did for this site!), I work in Figma.
- Similarly, I don‚Äôt do a lot of graphic design, but when I do, I typically use Inkscape.
