### Languages & Frameworks

- Whenever I can, I‚Äôm working in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
  - My preferred front-end framework is [React](https://react.dev/).
  - I‚Äôm also dipping into [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is what I used to build this site.
  - I‚Äôm comfortable working with vanilla JS as well, and I can jump into a project that‚Äôs still running [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) pretty easily, too.
  - On the back-end, I use [Node](https://nodejs.org) for my runtime, although I want to see what some of the newer alternatives have to offer soon (looking at you, [Bun](https://bun.sh/)).
  - For writing a web server, I‚Äôve historically used [Express](https://expressjs.com/). The next time I need a standalone web server, though, I‚Äôll probably give [Hono](https://hono.dev/) a shot.
  - I‚Äôve been using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the last couple of years for all of my full-stack JS apps, and I‚Äôve used it at least once strictly as a web server.
  - I‚Äôve written 90% of an app in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This will probably be my first and last foray into Electron, though, as [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) looks more interesting to me.
- I‚Äôm also comfortable in [PHP](https://www.php.net/). It was my first language, so it will always hold a special place in my heart.
  - I started writing PHP in about 2015. At the time, my focus was on hacky patches and tooling for [ZenCart](https://www.zen-cart.com/), none of which followed any kind of best practices.
  - I still write PHP pretty often, but it‚Äôs in the context of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) themes and plugins. I especially work a lot in [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/).
  - I‚Äôve also built a couple of apps in [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I liked using both, but I still prefer something like Next.js whenever possible.
- I‚Äôve worked pretty equally in relational and document databases (mostly [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)).
  - I‚Äôve recently started exploring [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and I really like it. It's probably going to be my go-to relational database for some time.
  - I‚Äôve been forced to work with [MSSQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) throughout my career. I am not a fan of the Transact-SQL syntax, but I can use it if I have to.
- I‚Äôve built a single [AMX](https://www.amx.com/en-US) automation system in their proprietary NetLinx language. It was a neat experience and I would do it again, even though I have complaints about the tooling and some of the language conventions.
- I‚Äôve dabbled in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/). I‚Äôm certainly not an expert in any of them, but I‚Äôm interested in learning more!

### Editor

- I‚Äôm a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) devotee. I converted early on in my coding career (late 2018) and haven‚Äôt looked back.
  - For my theme, I use my own [Jade](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=etoler1841.jade-theme) theme, which is a fork of Wes Bos‚Äôs [Cobalt 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) but green.
  - [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) is my font of choice, mostly because its cursive variant is also monospace and the same width as the regular font, which makes docblocks way easier to format.
  - I use a gazillion extensions, but the ones I most highly recommend are [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments), [Codeium](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeium.codeium), [PHP by DEVSENSE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode), [WordPress Hooks Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnbillion.vscode-wordpress-hooks), and [WordPress Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wordpresstoolbox.wordpress-toolbox).

### OS

- I‚Äôm comfortable in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments, but my primary workstations are all Windows machines. I do own a 2020 MacBook Pro, but I really hate the feel of the keyboard, so I almost never use it. Windows does what I need it to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Other Apps

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) is my daily driver. Maybe I‚Äôll eventually switch back to [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), but I‚Äôve always had performance issues with it, which is why I initially switched several years ago.
  - Now that the Windows version is ready, I may give [Arc](https://arc.net/) a try. I downloaded it on my Macbook a while ago, but I haven't made the time to explore it there yet. (I didn't realize the Windows version was out until I grabbed the link for this bullet point. I really may have to try it now.)
- I don‚Äôt pride myself on my UI/UX design skills, but when I do work in that space (like I did for this site!), I work in [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
- Similarly, I don‚Äôt do a lot of illustration, but when I do need an SVG for some reason, I typically use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
