<Section title="About">
	<p>Hi there! üëã</p>
	<p>
		I‚Äôm Erin! I‚Äôm a self-taught web developer from Pensacola, Florida, who specializes in JavaScript
		and PHP (WordPress) development. In my day job, I work at a local music as a solo developer, but
		I also occasionally take on interesting contract projects for local companies.
	</p>
	<p>
		I‚Äôm also a semi-professional trumpet player, private brass teacher, and former public school
		band director. I graduated from the University of West Florida in 2013 with a dual Bachelor‚Äôs
		degree in Music and Music Education.

<Section title="Uses">
	<Section title="Languages & Frameworks" level={3}>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Whenever I can, I‚Äôm working in TypeScript.
				<ul>
					<li>My preferred front-end framework is React.</li>
					<li>I‚Äôm also dipping into Svelte, which is what I used to build this site.</li>
					<li>
						I‚Äôm comfortable working with vanilla JS as well, and I can jump into a project that‚Äôs
						still running jQuery pretty easily, too.
					</li>
					<li>
						On the back-end, I use Node for my runtime, although I want to see what some of the
						newer alternatives have to offer soon.
					</li>
					<li>
						For writing a web server, I‚Äôve historically used Express. I think I‚Äôm done with it
						though, and next time I need a standalone web server, I‚Äôll probably use Hono.
					</li>
					<li>
						I‚Äôve been using Next.js for the last couple of years for all my full-stack JS apps, and
						I‚Äôve used it at least once strictly as a web server.
					</li>
					<li>
						I‚Äôve written 90% of an app in Electron. This will probably be my first and last foray
						into Electron, as Tauri looks more interesting to me.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				I‚Äôm also comfortable in PHP. It was my first language, so it will always hold a special
				place in my heart.
				<ul>
					<li>
						I started writing PHP back in about 2015. At the time, my focus was on hacky patches and
						tooling for ZenCart, none of which followed any kind of best practices.
					</li>
					<li>
						I still write PHP pretty often, but it‚Äôs in the context of WordPress themes and plugins.
						I especially work a lot in WooCommerce.
					</li>
					<li>
						I‚Äôve also built a couple of apps in Symfony and Laravel. I liked using both, but I still
						prefer something like Next.js whenever possible.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				I‚Äôve worked pretty equally in relational and document databases (mostly MySQL and MongoDB).
				<ul>
					<li>I‚Äôve recently started exploring Supabase and I really like it.</li>
					<li>
						I‚Äôve been forced to work with MSSQL throughout my career. I am not a fan of the
						Transact-SQL syntax, but I can use it if I have to.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				I‚Äôve built a single automation system in NetLinx. It was a neat experience and I would do it
				again, even though I have complaints about the tooling and some of the language conventions.
			</li>
			<li>
				I‚Äôve dabbled in Python, Go, Rust, and C#. I‚Äôm certainly not an expert in any of them, but
				I‚Äôm interested in learning more!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</Section>
	<Section title="Editor" level={3}>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I‚Äôm a Visual Studio Code devotee. I converted early on in my coding journey (late 2018) and
				haven‚Äôt looked back.
				<ul>
					<li>
						For my theme, I use my own Jade theme, which is a fork of Wes Bos‚Äôs Cobalt 2 but green.
					</li>
					<li>
						Victor Mono is my font of choice, mostly because its cursive variant is also monospace,
						which makes docblocks way easier to format. I want to make GitHub's Monaspace work, but
						there are still some weird little issues I haven't been able to get past.
					</li>
					<li>
						I use a gazillion extensions, but the ones I most highly recommend are Better Comments,
						Codeium, PHP, TypeScript Import Sorter, VS Sequential Number, WordPress Hooks
						Intellisense, and WordPress Snippets.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</Section>
	<Section title="OS" level={3}>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I‚Äôm comfortable in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments, but my primary workstations are all
				Windows machines. I do own a 2020 MacBook Pro, but I really hate the feel of the keyboard,
				so I almost never use it. Windows does what I need it to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
			</li>
		</ul>
	</Section>
	<Section title="Other Apps" level={3}>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Firefox is my daily driver. Maybe I‚Äôll eventually switch back to Chrome, but I‚Äôve always had
				performance issues with it, which is why I switched several years ago.
			</li>
			<li>
				I don‚Äôt pride myself on my UI/UX design skills, but when I do work in that space (like I did
				for this site!), I work in Figma.
			</li>
			<li>
				Similarly, I don‚Äôt do a lot of graphic design, but when I do, I typically use Inkscape.
			</li>
